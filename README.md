# Daily arXiv reader

This project contains the HTML, javascript and supporting media for the web page https://dailyarxiv.com, a tool I created to browse the arXiv publications of any area in any date.

I find it more convenient than the 'new', 'current' sections of the arXiv, because it groups manuscript from various areas, and it allows you to browse day by day, back from any particular date. This way, you can go out on conferencing and catch up when you return. It also uses some stupid algorithm to mark manuscripts that are reposted from other areas and which may be just updates.

The Daily arXiv reader exists thanks to the [arXiv.org API.](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index). Please do not abuse this project nor the web page I created.
